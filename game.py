    Card pool: 6 K cards, 6 Q cards, 6 A cards
    In each round, randomly select one K/Q/A card as the "specified card"
    There are two players, one of whom is a player and the other is a computer
    Start with a 6-round revolver pistol, with only 1 bullet (in the form of roulette)
    Each round sequence: Player 1 drops 1 - 2 face-down cards and declares them as the "specified card"
    Player 2 can choose to "believe" or "doubt"
    If the doubt is successful, Player 1 shoots himself; otherwise, Player 2 shoots himself
    If someone dies, the game ends; if not, the game continues by reshuffling the cards
    If "believed", it's Player 2's turn to drop
    Repeat the above sequence
    After each shot, the turn changes to the other player to drop first 
    Game ends after someone being hit once. 
    If one player finishes playing their cards first, the other player must doubt. 
    The player who survives in the end wins.
